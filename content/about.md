:wave: 嗨.

I'm YuCheng Kuo, a self-taught designer and engineer from Taiwan. Currently, I work as a UI/UX designer at [Oen Tech](https://oen.tw), where I help build software that integrates engagement, fundraising, and payment solutions for nonprofits, campaigns, and various organizations.

I'm fascinated by the interplay between technology and our daily lives—how it reshapes our world and how we, in turn, influence its future development.

## My Journey

My passion for digital design and web technologies originated with a goal during university: to make presentations more engaging. Noticing that most presentations were one-directional, I set out to improve audience engagement by:

- _Enhancing visual appeal_ (exploring layout and typography)
- _Incorporating meaningful animations_ (discovering motion graphics)
- _Finding the right presentation tools_ (which led me to [Prezi](https://prezi.com) and [Pitch](https://pitch.com), gateways to the world of web technologies.

These experiences, fueled by curiosity and continuous learning, fostered my love for both designing feasible solutions and developing with good design principles.

## Beyond work

Outside of history, you'll find me:

- Listening to a diverse range of music, including indie, R&B, alternative, and electronic genres. Seeking emotional connections through music.
- Enjoying TV shows and films that bring genuine smiles to my face.
- Reading books, primarily non-fiction—a habit I picked up that has been incredibly refreshing.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss design, technology, or any of my interests!
