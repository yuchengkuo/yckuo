Product designer and design engineer with 3+ years of experience building SaaS interfaces that drive user engagement and business growth. I had experience in designing complex workflows for B2B platforms, with proven ability to implement designs using React and modern frontend tools.

Currently at Oen Tech, I've led the design of critical features that serve 50k+ users across 200+ clients, including event check-in systems and payment dashboards. My background in both design and engineering enables me to create solutions that are not only user-centric but also technically sound. I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can leverage my full-stack product skills to deliver measurable impact.
