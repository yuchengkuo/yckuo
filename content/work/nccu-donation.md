tagline: Modernizing NCCU's donation platform with brand-aligned design and streamlined user experience.

summary:
  context: Our platform equips educational institutions with integrated donation management tools that handle payments, receipts, and donor relationships. For NCCU, we not only delivered a custom donation experience but also enhanced our core platform with new functionalities that addressed their specific institutional requirements.
  challenge: NCCU required a donation website that preserved their brand while delivering a more refined user experience. The challenge was to create a tailored user experience for their donors while developing new platform features that would benefit all clients.
  process: I analyzed NCCU's existing site and brand guidelines to identify improvement opportunities.  Through each design iteration responded to stakeholder feedback, we ensure alignment with institutional goals and user needs. This allowed us to maintained familiar navigation patterns while introducing cleaner layouts ans smooth donation flow.
  solution: The final design featured a brand-aligned interface with streamlined donation flows plus significant platform enhancements. We expanded our payment processing options, implemented flexible donation cycles, and developed automated appreciation communications, delivering a solution that met NCCU's needs while improving our platform's core capabilities.
  impact: NCCU gained comprehensive donor management capabilities while presenting a professional interface to donors, now processing over 200 monthly donations and handling $10M+ in monthly transactions. This successful implementation established our credibility in the education sector, leading to partnerships with similar institutions.
