tagline: Streamlining the path to purchase by eliminating cross-domain friction and keeping users engaged from discovery to confirmation.

summary:
  context: Oen provides businesses, non-profits, and campaigns with an all-in-one platform for selling products and managing customer relationships. The e-commerce solution allows clients to showcase merchandise on their branded websites, while our payment processing and order management systems handle the transaction.
  challenge: Users originally had to navigate from a merchant's website to our user domain to complete purchases, creating a significant friction at the critical conversion point. This not only interrupted the shopping experience but also disrupted our analytics data, making it difficult to track complete customer journeys.
  process: We mapped the customer journey to find where users were dropping off and examined how other platforms handle checkout flows. By focusing on keeping users in one place, we designed a solution that work within our existing technical framework while improving the user experience.
  solution: We rebuilt the new checkout system that operates within the merchant's domain, maintaining visual consistency and brand identity throughout the purchase process. The redesigned flow keeps users in their original context with a streamlined, step-by-step progression, providing users a unified experience from product browsing to order confirmation.
  impact: The redesigned checkout process resulted in approxiamtely 15% decrease in purchase completion time across 2,000+ monthly transactions, directly increasing the revenue. We also gained visibility into user behavior during the purchase process, allowing for better optimization, leading to improved customer satisfaction and brand consistency for our clients.
