tagline: Transforming the platform's digital presence with clear messaging and engaging design and animation.

summary:
  context: Oen is a payment platform that helps businesses run events, online stores, and membership programs. Working as both designer and developer, I helped rebuild our company website to better show what our product does and why it matters to customers.
  challenge: Our original homepage didn't clearly explain what our platform offered, making it hard for potential clients to understand our value. The visual design also needed updating to better align with current design standards and create a more trustworthy impression for our target audience.
  solution: The updated homepage features a fresh, modern look with elements that appear as users scroll down the page. We added sections for our services, customer feedback, helpful articles, and common questions. I built custom animations to highlight key features and created a new contact page to collect visitor information.
  impact: The transformed homepage made it easier for visitors to understand what we offer, resulting in increased lead generation and improved time-on-site. Animations in feature section also contributed to reduction in bounce rate.
