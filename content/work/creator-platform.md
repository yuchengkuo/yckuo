tagline: Building a multi-tiered creator platform that seamlessly connects creators with fans through digital content.

summary:
  context: Fansta is a platform enabling content creators to monetize their work through subscriptions, digital products, and fan interactions. We designed and built the multi-tiered ecosystem for them where creators can manage their content, memberships, and revenue while providing fans with easy access to premium digital content.
  challenge: We faced a tight timeline to build a complex platform that handled content sales, subscription management, and payment processing for all users. This demanded rapid decision-making and efficient workflows without compromising on quality or functionality.
  process: I mapped out how all users would interact with each other and understand user flows for key actions like creator application or purchasing content. Working with the team, I developed a consistent design system that could work across the platform while remaining flexible for different user needs.
  solution: The final design features three main interfaces, an admin panel for Fansta to manage the platform, a dashboard for creators to sell and track their content, and a storefront for fans to browse and buy. Each interface uses the same visual elements and interaction patterns, making the entire platform feel connected and easy to use.
  impact: The platform has helped Fansta reach the creator community they wanted to serve, while proving our ability to build complex, customizable solutions. This project added valuable features to our core product, including digital content management and multi-level access controls.
