tagline: Revamping website creation to unlock personalization while maintaining simplicity for diverse business needs.

summary:
  context: Our platform provides businesses and organizations with an integrated website builder as part of our CRM-driven payment solution. This tool enables them to create their digital storefront without technical expertise, serving as the primary connection point between their brand and customers.
  challenge: The existing website builder limited customization options, resulting in similar-looking sites across different businesses despite varying brand identities. The editor also lacked component consistency and real-time preview capabilities, making it challenging for users to visualize their changes effectively.
