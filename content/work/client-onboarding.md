tagline: Transforming client acquisition with an intuitive, automated onboarding portal for SaaS business.

summary:
  context: Oen offers a payment platform that helps businesses manage events, online sales, and membership programs in one unified system. Before this project, new clients could only be added to the platform through manual setup by our internal team. This project addresses the need for a more efficient client onboarding process.
  challenge: The business team was spending much time manually collecting and processing new client information, creating barriers in the onboarding process and slowing down overall business growth. The team struggled to efficiently gather essential details such as official business names, brand assets, banking information, and required documentation, resulting in a time-consuming experience for both the team and new clients.
  solution: The final solution was an invite-based client onboarding portal where business team members could generate unique invitation links through the admin panel to share with clients. This portal guided new clients through a structured process to provide all necessary business information and account details, automatically creating their accounts and making them immediately visible in the admin panel for review and approval.
  impact: The implementation of the client onboarding portal automated 80% of manual onboarding tasks, reducing setup time from 3-5 days to under 4 hours, allowing the business team to focus on relationship building rather than administrative tasks. The structured data collection process also ensured higher quality client information, reducing errors and follow-up communications.
