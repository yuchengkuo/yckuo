tagline: Evolving a scalable design system that unifies product experiences and accelerates team collaboration.

summary:
  context: Oen Tech provides a CRM-driven payment platform offering event hosting, e-commerce, and membership management services for businesses and organizations. Our digital products serve diverse clients including nonprofits, political parties, and campaigns, requiring a flexible yet consistent design approach across multiple touchpoints.
  challenge: The initial design guideline I created in 2020 improved team efficiency but needed expansion. As our product grew, we encountered gaps in component coverage and inconsistencies in patterns and interactions. These design variations affected our workflow and made it harder to maintain quality across features.
