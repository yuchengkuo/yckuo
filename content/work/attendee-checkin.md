tagline: Seamless mobile QR-code verification that transforms event management into actionable attendee insights.

summary:
  context: Oen provides a platform where clients can create and sell tickets for their events through our hosting solution. While the system handled ticket sales effectively, it lacked a way for organizers to verify attendees and collect valuable attendance data at the venue.
  challenge: Event hosts could sell tickets through our platform but had no efficient way to check in attendees during events. This gap prevented organizers from tracking who actually attended their events and limited their ability to gather insights for future planning.
  process: I designed a mobile-first scanning solution that prioritized speed and reliability. The design focused on minimal steps and clear visual feedback to handle high-volume entry periods without creating lines or delays.
  solution: The final design features a straightforward mobile scanning interface that confirms attendance instantly and integrates smoothly with the existing platform. The system provides clear success and error messages, allowing event hosts to quickly process attendees while maintaining accurate attendance records.
  impact: This feature has processed 2000+ check-ins across major events like Megaport Festival and Kuma Academy, reducing entry bottlenecks. Event hosts have access to attendance data that helps them plan better events and marketing, significantly enhancing the value of our platform.
